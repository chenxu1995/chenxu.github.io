I am a researcher in psychoacoustics and digital hearing healthcare, with a PhD from the University of Oldenburg. My work focuses on mobile-based auditory diagnostics, loudness perception, and the development of precision digital therapeutics for hearing loss. I developed the Virtual Hearing Clinic, an app-based platform that integrates hearing science with smartphone technology to make hearing diagnostics more accessible worldwide.
